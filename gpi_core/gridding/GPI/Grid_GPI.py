    """Gridding module for Post-Cartesian Data - works with 2D and 3D data

    INPUTS:
    data - k-space complex data - if not supplied, Grid uses "1" for all of its data
    coords - k-space coordinates, normalized in units of "1/resolution", i.e. ranging from -0.5 to 0.5
               Last dimension must be 1, 2 or 3 (corresponding to kx, kx/ky, or kx/ky/kz, respectively)
               Coordinates at the very edge of gridded k-space then have values of -/+ 0.5
    weighting - sampling density correction - if not supplied, Grid uses "1"
    params_in - optional dictionary from (e.g.) spiralcoords, to automatically specify the effective matrix

    OUTPUTS:
    gridded data, which is M+E dimensions, where
                  M is 1, 2 or 3, depending on last dimension of coords input (i.e. 1D, 2D, or 3D)
                    The size of these M dimensions is 1.5 times the given effective matrix
                  E is (# input data dims) - (Dims per set widget value)
                    E represents slices, coils, etc., which don't get gridded together.

    WIDGETS:
    Dims per Set - How many dimensions get gridded into the same space (and the space is determined by the last dim of coords)
                   Remaining dimensions are independent, e.g. for slices, coils, etc.
    Eff MTX XY - number of pixels in the final image (XY), nominally (without zero-padding) given by FOV/resolution
      Add 25% to matrix for "true resolution" for (e.g.) spiral
      Output data are gridded to a matrix 50% larger than this to mitigate gridding artifacts
    Eff MTX Z - number of pixels in the final image (Z), nominally (without zero-padding) given by FOV/resolution
      Add 25% to matrix for "true resolution" for (e.g.) stack of cones, spherical distributed spiral, FLORET
      Output data are gridded to a matrix 50% larger than this to mitigate gridding artifacts
    dx, dy, dz - for off-center FOV correction.  Specify number of pixels in each direction to shift (in image space)
                 prior to gridding.

      Note on Input dimensions: If coords is N dimensions, with the last used for the 2D/3D information,
                                  1) weights must have N-1 dimensions, of the same shape as corresponding coords
                                  2) data can have N-1 or more dimensions (of correct shape)
                                  3) If data has extra dimension (the first dimensions), data from each index
                                       in these dimensions are gridded using the same coords and weights

      Examples:  2D Spiral Gridding, 4-channel coil, 22 slices, 32 arms, 4056 points per interleaf
                     data are complex, 4 x 22 x 32 x 4056
                     coords are real,      22 x 32 x 4056 x 2
                     weights are real,     22 x 32 x 4056
                     Dims per Set widget is 2
                     Eff Mtx XY widget is 200
                     output data size is 4 x 22 x 300 x 300

                 3D Distributed Spiral Gridding, 8 coils, 320 arms, 4056 points per interleaf
                     data are complex, 8 x 320 x 4056
                     coords are real,      320 x 4056 x 3
                     weights are real,     320 x 4056
                     Dims per Set widget is 2
                     Eff Mtx XY widget is 160
                     Eff Mtx Z widget is 120
                     output data size is 8 x 180 x 240 x 240

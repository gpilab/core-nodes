## This file is a collection of extra packages that are either being used in the development of new core nodes, or are of potential general interest to MRI researchers.

- [pyqtgraph]: a graphics library with some advantages over `matplotlib`. Currently being used in development of an image analysis node.
- [BioSPPy](https://github.com/PIA-Group/BioSPPy): A toolbox for biosignal processing written in Python. Useful for processing physiology data. Only available from `pip`, not `conda`, making it difficult to use within GPI itself.
